<p style="text-align:center;">
Traceless<br>
Head over heels <br>
Whimsical nonsense <br>
I stand corrected amongst my peers <br>

Tiptoe around the mountain <br>
Reel around the fountain <br>
Slabs on top of slabs <br>
I shine my way through the ominous pan <br>
 <br>
 If doubt invades consciousness <br>
 If essence precedes existence <br>
 Let it transcend all senses <br>
 Let the pit be bottomless <br>
 <br>
 Shimmering stashes of tenacious greed <br>
 My body swims as God sees fit <br>
 Whining over loss until death pulls apart <br>
 Endless supply of fulfilling sand <br>
 <br>
 A downward spiral Iâ€™m placed in <br>
 A flea in a can in a river of tin <br>
 My growth as forevisioned in the crystal dome <br>
 Shoulders stretch as my sense gets torn <br>
