## 2012 - 2017 (2018)

Coming from the record label Other People, Against All Logic's previous releases sounded strangely similar to Nicolas Jaar's efforts, so the reveal of A.A.L being, in fact, Nicolas Jaar, didn't come as a surprise. However, this facade Jaar decided to wear served more than just as a marketing tool. 2012 - 2017 takes Jaar's organic sonic textures to the dancefloor, bringing much needed novelty to the dance music genre.


As a whole, 2012 - 2017 outstands because of Jaar's brilliant, organic usage of samples, inserted in otherwise traditional EDM songs. This is seen form the start to the end of the album:


*This Old House is All I Have* is a droney, noisy electronic songs, with glitches and samples scattered all around it. Similar in texture to Some Kind of Game, which is the most similar there is to traditional IDM.

*I Never Dream* and *Know You* are dreamy, calm, and vintage. The seamless mixing of vocals and synths create an immersive experience.

*Cityfade* and *Now U Got me Hooked* are urban, sample-heavy.

This approach to sampling, which is a revision on 80s and 90s French house music sampling (early Daft Punk, Stardust, Kavinsky, Air) was almost monopolized by Fuck Button's Blanck Mass (see the World Eater LP).

Though not Jaar's most ambitious project, 2012 - 2017 is a watered-down, comprehensive body of self-contained songs. Apparently, there is room for experimentation.
