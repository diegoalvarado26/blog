# About

This is my personal blog. Here i'll be uploading stuff about
* Things i learn at uni/on my own
* Opinions on music
* Insight i get while thinking about stuff

This blog was previously hosted on Blogger, but that is old tech now, and customization wasn't really possible there (it, in essence, was just an online Word interface).
Now i'm using Github Pages + Jekyll, which come in handy and really complement one another (Jekyll lets you create static pages, and Github offer free hosting).
